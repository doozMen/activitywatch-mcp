[INFO] Getting Claude analysis...
Based on the activity data provided, here's my analysis of today's productivity and work patterns:

## üéØ Key Achievements

**Primary Focus: Timestory MCP Development**
- Spent 3+ hours on database schema fixes and making the system repeatable
- Major refactoring work to integrate Point-Free's sharing GRDB pattern
- Successfully made the system "repeatable by any AI"

**Secondary Projects:**
- 21 minutes on CueApp development in Xcode
- 24 minutes on ActivityWatch MCP summary integration with Claude
- Development environment setup and tooling improvements

## ‚è∞ Work Patterns

**Total Active Time:** ~3.5 hours of focused development work

**Work Distribution:**
- 70% on opens-time-chat/timestory-mcp (main project)
- 20% on CueApp (client work)
- 10% on tooling and environment setup

**Peak Productivity Blocks:**
1. **Schema fixes session:** 1h 11m of sustained focus
2. **Repeatability implementation:** 34m focused block
3. **CueApp development:** 21m concentrated session

## üí° Productivity Insights

**Strengths:**
- Strong focus on a single major objective (making the system repeatable)
- Good use of terminal/CLI for development workflow
- Minimal context switching between major tasks

**Observations:**
- Low activity detection (only 2 events in tracking buckets) suggests possible tracking gaps
- Multiple short sessions on installation/setup tasks indicate environment configuration work
- Evidence of documentation work (SCHEMA.md, migration status)

## üîß Technical Progress

- Database schema improvements for timestory-mcp
- Integration with Point-Free's GRDB sharing pattern
- Enhanced repeatability for AI interactions
- ActivityWatch MCP summary pipeline development

**Recommendation:** The low event count in activity tracking suggests either a tracking issue or significant time spent thinking/planning. Consider checking if ActivityWatch watchers are running properly.
